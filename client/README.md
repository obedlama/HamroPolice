## HamroPolice
YOu can get serve from HamroPolice if any of these things are happening now or have just happened:

   * someone is badly injured or in danger, for example there's been a car crash and people are hurt;
   * thereâ€™s a serious risk to life or property, like when a fight breaks out in the street;
   * a crime is happening and the person who did it is still there or has just left, for example when   someone is in your neighbour's garden and you see them break into the house;
   * something has happened that could be dangerous, like trees blocking a road.
